The crisis over clothing imports is still hitting the headlines,
and we spoke to some of the people involved. </br>
In portugal, joao da divla owns a small factory in Aveiro.
</p>


<p>
Look, i can not see any problem with these import controls.
The European Union should protect European industry,
people like me and my factory workers.
</p>


<p>
We can not produce clothing at the prices the chinese charge.</br>
I employ a small number of people, it is true, but they depend on me.
</p>


<p>
Where else could they work around here?</br>
My message to Mr Mandelson is this: stop the chinese imports, support
European producers.
</p>


<p>
But it is a different message from the retail clothing chain Tulip(郁金香)
Listen to what Dagmar Rasmussen has to say.
</p>


<p>
We in the retail trade really think we should import garments from china,
or from malaysia, or from any country that can supply us at a good price.
</p>


<p>
Why should the European Union tell us where and how to do business? </br>
We are not at all happy with this situation.</br>
Our shops could be almost completely empty next week.</br></br>
What are we going to say to our customers?</br>
The European Trade Commissioner should act at once, and permit the clothes 
to leave the warehouses and to stock our shops.</br>
Really, this can not go on!
