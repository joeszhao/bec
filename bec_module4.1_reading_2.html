<h1>business2business: global communication</h1>

<p>

Teleconferecncing is a great way to connect people who work in  different parts of the world.<br/>
 It is cheaper and quicker than face to face meetings, and people can communicate more informally, sitting in their offices or even working from home.<br/>

</p>
<p>
 If you want your teleconference to be effective, you should plan  it like a face to face meeting.<br/>
 first of all, find a date that is convenient for everyone. <br/>
 Remember time difference, and be careful to specify the local time of the virtual meeting:
 <br> New York is five hours behind London, so if you want a teleconference with some in New York, 
 <br>the best time is probably after 2pm in London.<br/>
Limit the number of the participants,managing a teleconference with more than 5 people can be stressful.<br/>
</p>
<p>
Before the meeting, send out the agenda so that everyone knows the topics to discussion.<br/>
send all participants the documents for the meeting.<br/>
</p>

<p>
The person who calls the meeting is usually also the moderator.<br/>
Before you speak, always say your name,this is stephanie, so that everyone knows who is saying what.<br/>
Silence on the phone does not mean absence.<br/>
Maybe someone is preparing a question or thinking of an answer.<br/>
And here is another tip.<br/>
When you are not speaking, press the mute button so that you can listen to who is talking, 
<br/>but the others will not hear your background noises.<br/>
