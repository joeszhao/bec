<p>and now i would like to turn on the final section of the report.<br>

As you can see, last year was an excellent year in production.<br>

</p>


<p>
The first two quarters were rather slow, but as a result of new orders from Asia, <br>
our production rose dramatically in the third and fourth quarter.<br>

This situation was reflected, of course, in our sales for last year.<br>
<br>
We started the year in a strong position, but in the second quarter worldwide sales fell sharply.<br>

This was a result  of the hight oil price.<br>
</p>

<p>

However, as I mentioned earlier, new orders from Asia  meant that sales went up to their previous level by the end of the year.<br>

Looking now at the share price, I am delighted to announce that last year was also an 
excellent year in this respect.<br>

The share price rose steadily for the first two quarters, and it remained steady at its maximum for the rest of the year.<br>

All in all, last year was a very positive year.....<br>
