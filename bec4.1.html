<p>The fashion industry in Europe is facing its biggest crisis recent history.
</p>

<p>
Clothing retailers such as H&M, zara and C&A could have empty shops at 
christmas because chinese imprts are stuck in europe ports.

</p>
<p>
At the moment, millions of chinese bras, sweaters and T-shirts are sitting in customs
warehouse around europe, <br>following the introduction of import controls in june by the
european trade commissioner, peter mandelson.

</p>
<p>
A sopkeswomen for the retailers said that many samll companies are suffering because they can not sell these chinese imports.<br>
people could lose their jobs and small retailers are facing huge losses, said Anna Price.<br>
The EU should release these goods as soon as possible, in time for the christmas season.<br>

</p>
<p>
On the other hand, countries such as italy, spain and portugal are in favour of the import restrictions.<br>
These countries employ many people in the textile industry.<br>
They do not want chinese clothing to flood the market because then can not compete with chinese prices.<br>

</p>
<p>
Mr Mandelson is in a difficult position:<br>
Maintaining the controls could be a disaster for the retailers.<br>
But allowing the imports could be equally disastrous for the southern European producers.<br>
Meanwhile, the warehouses are filling up with winter season fashions which nobody will want next winter.</p>
