<p>And now for the business news from Susan Fleming.</br>
Today's headline is that china and the European Union have just announced that an
end to the clothing blockade has been agreed.
</p>
<p>
Millions of fashion items are sitting in ports around Europe, Where they have been since import restrictions were introduced in June.
</p>
<p>
Today, however, both sides in the dispute have reached an agreement and the clothes will be in the shops soon.
</p>
<p>
The EU will accept all of the 80 million items.
</p>
<p>
However, only 50 per cent of these items are part of this year's import.
The other 50 per cent will be part of next year's import quotas.
</p>
<p>
China agreed to this solution, which is a compromise on both sides.
</p>
<p>
The agreement is a victory for Peter Mandelson, the EU trade commissioner.
</p>
<p>
And on the stock exchange...
