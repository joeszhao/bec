The new management have decided to invest in staff training.<br>

Oh, really? I knew nothing about that. What do they want us to do?<br>

They want us to improve our performance then presenting and negotiating,<br>
and make the most of our computer skill. <br>
Somebody has complained that our computer are out of date and so are our skills!<br>

Yes, I think they are right. Personally, I need to work on how to prepare my presentations.<br>

Me too. Let's start with presentation skills, then.<br>
