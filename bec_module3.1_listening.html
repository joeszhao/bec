Our guest today on Song of my life is the entrepreneur
Martha Lane Fox, of the massively successful company lastminute.com
</p>
<p>
With her business partner, Brent Hoberman, Martha Lane Fox started
lastminutes.com in Brent's living room.

<p>

The idea was simple, a website selling late flights and late hotel bookings.
<p>

The company grew very quickly and expand from the UK into France,
Germany and Sweden.
<p>

They bought other travel companies, and after six years they had 1400 
employees.
<p>

Lastminute.com went public in 2000, and the shares  in the company 
increased their value by 40 per cent in two days.
<p>

Martha Lane Fox left the company in 2003. 
True to her entrepreneurial spirit, she wanted to start more new 
companies.
<p>

Martha, it's a pleasure to have you here in the studio....
